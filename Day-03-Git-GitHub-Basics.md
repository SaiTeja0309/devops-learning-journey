# Day 03 – Git & GitHub Basics 🚀

## 📌 Objective
Understand the fundamentals of **Git** and **GitHub**, and learn how to manage source code using version control from the Linux command line.


---

## 🔹 What is Version Control?
Version Control Systems (VCS) help track changes in code over time.  
They allow developers to:
- Collaborate efficiently
- Revert to previous versions
- Maintain code history

### Types of VCS:
- **Centralized VCS** – Single central server (e.g., SVN)
- **Distributed VCS** – Every user has a full copy (e.g., Git)

---

## 🔹 What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development.

### Key Benefits:
- Fast and reliable
- Supports branching & merging
- Offline work possible
- Widely used in DevOps & CI/CD

---

## 🔹 What is GitHub?
GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories and enables collaboration.

### Git vs GitHub:
| Git | GitHub |
|---|---|
| Version control tool | Hosting & collaboration platform |
| Works locally | Works online |
| CLI-based | UI + CLI |

## 🔹 Git Installation & Configuration (Linux)

Install "git" in 
    - Amazon Linux: sudo yum install git
    - debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install git

Check version of git:
