## 🔹 What is Version Control?
Version Control Systems (VCS) help track changes in code over time.  
They allow developers to:
- Collaborate efficiently
- Revert to previous versions
- Maintain code history

### Types of VCS:
- **Centralized VCS** – Single central server (e.g., SVN)
- **Distributed VCS** – Every user has a full copy (e.g., Git)
